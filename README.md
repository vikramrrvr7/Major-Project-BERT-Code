Instructions To run the Code.
1.	Open Jupyter Notebook: Open your Jupyter Notebook by either searching for it in your applications or running it from the command line if you have Anaconda installed. You can open it by typing jupyter notebook in the terminal or command prompt.

2.	Navigate to the Directory: Once Jupyter Notebook is opened in your web browser, navigate to the directory where your Python file is located. You can do this by clicking through the file browser in Jupyter Notebook.

3.	Upload Python File: If your Python file is not already in the Jupyter Notebook directory, you'll need to upload it. Click the "Upload" button, then select your Python file from your downloads folder.

4.	Create a New Notebook: If you want to run your Python code in a new notebook, you can create one by clicking the "New" button in the top right corner and selecting "Python 3" (or whichever Python kernel you prefer).

5.	Import Python File: If you're running your code in an existing notebook, or if you've created a new notebook, you'll need to import your Python file. You can do this using the %run magic command followed by the path to your Python file. 

6.	Run Code Cells: If your Python file contains code in separate cells (if it's a Jupyter notebook converted from a Python script, for example), you'll need to run each cell containing code individually. You can do this by selecting the cell and either clicking the "Run" button in the toolbar or pressing Shift+Enter.

7.	View Output: Any output generated by your Python code will be displayed below the code cell. This includes print statements, plot visualizations, or any other output your code produces.

8.	That's it! You should now be able to run your Python code from a Jupyter Notebook. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
